title: Memory leak in thread connection pool of net-http-persistent
date: 2015-04-08
description: |
  3.0.0 introduced a memory leak when it switched to connection pooling. We're
  setting a thread local but then never clearing the local. If the pool is used
  in the main thread, it will never die and the locals will stick around for
  the life of the process.
leaky_versions:
  - "= 3.0.0"
patched_versions:
  - "> 3.0.0"
